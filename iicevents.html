            Innovation Cell (MIC) launched the Institution’s Innovation Council (IIC) program in collaboration
            with AICTE for Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) to systematically foster the culture of innovation and
            start-up ecosystem in education institutions. Under IIC our Institution has been performing various
            activities in past years, and had continued to do the same even though the whole year is undergone to the
            pandemic. PIET -IIC got 3.5 Star Rating allotted by MOE India. The institution is dedicated to conducting
            activities related to IP, start-up and innovation during 2019-20 under the IIC flagships. These activities
            were appreciated by all stakeholders and thus we got motivated to improve in the last year i.e., 2021-22. In
            the year 2021-22 IIC of PIET has organized 65 activities to address research &amp; innovation, start-up,
            internship, IPR etc. Institute organized start-up innovation contest to provide a platform to young

            IPR and to convert projects into IP. Council tried to develop and nurture young brains to create new
            initiatives based on innovation and starting start-ups. In this session four IPR, three start up session,
