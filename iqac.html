                      <h1 style="margin-left: 2vw;">Operational Features of the IQAC</h1>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; margin-left: 2vw;">Quality assurance is a by-product of ongoing efforts to define the objectives of an institution, to have a work plan to achieve them and to specify the checks and balances to evaluate the degree to which each of the tasks is fulfilled. Hence devotion and commitment to improvement rather than mere institutional control is the basis for devising procedures and instruments for assuring quality. The right balance between the health and growth of an institution needs to be struck. The IQAC has to ensure that whatever is done in the institution for "education" is done efficiently and effectively with high standards. In order to do this, the IQAC will have to first establish procedures and modalities to collect data and information on various aspects of institutional functioning. <br><br>
                      The coordinator of the IQAC and the secretary will have a major role in implementing these functions. The IQAC may derive major support from the already existing units and mechanisms that contribute to the functions listed above. The operational features and functions discussed so far are broad-based to facilitate institutions towards academic excellence and institutions may adapt them to their specific needs.
                      </p>
            
                      <h1 style="margin-left: 2vw;">Monitoring Mechanism</h1>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; margin-left: 2vw;">The institutions need to submit yearly the Annual Quality Assurance Report (AQAR) to NAAC. A functional Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) and timely submission of Annual Quality Assurance Reports (AQARs) are the Minimum Institutional Requirements (MIR) to volunteer for second, third or subsequent cycle's accreditation. During the institutional visit the NAAC peer teams will interact with the IQACs to know the progress, functioning as well quality sustenance initiatives undertaken by them. <br><br>
                      The Annual Quality Assurance Reports (AQAR) may be the part of the Annual Report. The AQAR shall be approved by the statutory bodies of the HEIs (such as Syndicate, Governing Council/Board) for the follow up action for necessary quality enhancement measures. <br><br>
                      The Higher Education Institutions (HEI) shall submit the AQAR regularly to NAAC. The IQACs may create its exclusive window on its institutional website and regularly upload/ report on its activities, as well as for hosting the AQAR.
                      </p>

                        <li><b>Outcome based education:</b>IQAC conducted meetings with all the faculty members to adopt this practice for effective teaching-learning. The guidelines were given to all the faculty members for drafting the Course Outcomes (COs), Programme Specific Outcomes (PSOs), and Programme Educational Objectives (PEOs) and to determine the attainment of POs. COs were defined as per syllabus using Blooms Taxonomy and mapped with POs and PSOs according to correlation level. CO attainment were calculated at the end of each course using direct and indirect methods. The outcomes were communicated to both teachers and students.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>R&D, Industry Institute Interaction, Consultancy, Incubation:</b>To establish entrepreneurship development center/incubation center and sign MoUs collaborations with a number of industries for mutually-beneficial interaction and organize at least 10 joint programs. </li>
