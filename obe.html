        Outcome-based Education (OBE) emphasizes on many components in terms of student achievement in
        a program. The most important components are the Program Outcomes (POs), Program Educational <br><br>
        Objectives (PEOs) and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs). POs, as stated by NBA, represent the
        knowledge, skills and attitudes the students should have at the end of a four-year engineering program
        in India, whereas, PEOs are broad statements that describe the career and professional accomplishments
        in three to five years after graduation that the program is preparing graduates to achieve. PSOs are
        statements that describe what the graduates of a specific engineering program should be able to do.
        Other important components are Course Objectives, Course Outcomes and Lecture Outcomes. A course
        objective broadly describes what a faculty member will cover in a course, whereas Course Outcomes
        are the detailed description of the abilities what a student must acquire at the conclusion of a course.
        They are the resultant knowledge, skills and attributes the student acquires at the end of a course. It
        defines the cognitive processes a course provides. Lecture Outcomes state what students will know or

        Be able to do as a result of one-hour session or activity. They can also be expressed as knowledge, skills,
        or attitudes. <br><br>
        Outcome mapping facilitates the alignment of Course Outcomes with Program Outcomes and Program
        Specific Outcomes. It allows faculty members to create a visual map of a program. It is also used to
        explore how students are meeting Program Outcomes at the course level. Outcomes mapping mainly
        focuses on student learning. Every COs should be mapped to different POs and PSOs based on their
        influence of COs on them.

    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 40px; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        In the process to map COs with POs and PSOs, the Course Outcomes are designed in such a way so that they can fulfill the requirements of Program Outcomes and Program Specific Outcomes. The keywords used to identify COs, bloom's taxonomy has been referred in conjunction with the course syllabus. The Course Outcomes are designed by Course Coordinators and finalized by Quality Improvement Committee (QIC) to achieve the Vision of the department with the help of its mission statements. In order to attain the defined COs in effective and efficient manner, course coordinators design the Lecture Outcomes in line with Course Outcome. <br><br>
        The following steps are used to formulate course outcome:
        <ul>
            <li>Detail study of Program Outcomes and Program Specific Outcomes.</li>
            <li>Identification of keywords from the Program Outcomes and Program Specific Outcomes.</li>
            <li>Identification of keywords from Bloom's Taxonomy with can be mapped with keywords identified from Program Outcomes.</li>
            <li>Conjunction of keywords with the course curriculum.</li>
            <li>Draft course outcomes for each of the courses in the curriculum  according to Program Outcomeand using mapping verb from Bloom's Taxonomy.</li>
            <li>There are two parts of each course outcome: action verbs and learning statement.</li>
            <li>Identification of the questions to be used to assess the Course Outcome and fulfill the requirements of Program Outcomes.</li>
            <li>Evaluation of questions based on two parameters: <br>
                1-Does CO1 reflects the intended measurement from PO1?
                2-Does the assessment correlates well with the CO?
            </li>
            <li>Based on the above parameters, the COs are finalized along with their mapping with POs(Substantially, Moderately or Slightly).</li>
            <li>Develop course outcomes for each of the courses in the curriculum.</li>

    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 40px; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        The strength of mapping of COs with POs and PSOs are defined at three levels: <br><br>
         Level#1: Slight or Low <br>
         Level#2: Moderate or Medium <br>
         Level#3: Substantial or High <br><br>

         Method used to define the correlation level is based on the course hours devoted to the specific Course Outcome which address the given Program Outcome. Following formula has been used to show the connection between a single Course Outcome and Program Outcome and Program Specific Outcome. The COs-POs and COs-PSOs mapping depends on two factors: first, the learning level and second, the hours provided for that learning level. There are three learning levels are identified for this purpose.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 40px; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
       The Institute has been established in the year 2007 with the vision to create knowledge based society and to become valuable resource for enriching mankind. The Department of Computer Engineering has been incepted in same year with the objective to create an environment to produce competent technocrats and innovators. The Department level Committee has executed SWOT analysis on performance of the first Batch of BTech(CS) graduated in the year 2011, according to the objectives and presented report to governing council. Seventh meeting of The Governing Council of the institute was conducted on 9th September 2011. With reference to swot Analysis presented in the meeting, it was proposed by the Chairman to define the department’s Vision, Mission and Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) in line to the Vision, Mission of the institute. The Program Accreditation Assessment Committee (PAAC) has been formed on principle’s notice to develop and establish Vision, Mission and Program Education objectives of the department and program respectively. The PAAC consists of Head of the Department, senior faculty members, employers, parents and alumni. The meeting of PAAC was conducted on 11th November, 2011 to define Vision, Mission and PEOs. In this meeting inputs and views were taken from all Committee members. The first draft was sent to Quality Improvement Committee (QIC) for approval. QIC conducted survey and took advices and comments from all internal and External stakeholders and then QIC suggested some amendments based on the inputs, feedbacks, surveys and experiences of all stakeholders. In the next meeting of PAAC vision, mission and PEOs are corrected and finalized by QIC.After getting improvement and suggestions received from QIC, the second meeting of PAAC was organized to finalize the vision, mission and PEOs after incorporating suggestions made by QIC. The Vision, Mission and PEOs were presented to Governing Council for approval. The mission statements are reviewed on yearly basis by the PAAC so that latest trends and scenarios can be adopted in the field of Computer Engineering.</p>
